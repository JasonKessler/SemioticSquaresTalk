Lexicon Mining for Semiotic Squares: Exploding Binary Classification
Data Day Texas 2018 Talk
Jason S. Kessler

Please see the Jupyter notebook [Class-Association-Scores](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JasonKessler/SemioticSquaresTalk/blob/master/notebooks/Class-Association-Scores.ipynb) for annotated code showing lexicon mining algorithms ane examples of using [Scattertext](https://github.com/JasonKessler/scattertext) for creating semiotic squares.


The presentation is available on Slideshare [here](https://www.slideshare.net/JasonKessler/lexicon-mining-for-semiotic-squares-exploding-binary-classification).
